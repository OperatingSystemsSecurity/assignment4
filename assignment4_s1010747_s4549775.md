We assume that both the Bell-LaPadula, and the Biba rules use weak tranquility.

|action|access allowed|Bell-LaPadula level|Biba level|
|-----:|:------------:|:-----------------:|:--------:|
i|\y|unclassified|trusted
ii|\y|unclassified|system
iii|\n|unclassified|system
iv|\y|unclassified|system
v|\y|confidential|system
vi|\n|confidential|system

Peter's process must not drop below level "application", but Biba disallows read-down, so the process is denied access to `/home/peter/database`, because it requires application "user" or lower to be read. The action iii is disallowed.

Action vi is disallowed, because Biba disallows write-up, and the process has level "system", but it would need "trusted" to be allowed to write `/etc/shadow`. Bell-LaPadula allows write-up, so that is not a problem.

## b
